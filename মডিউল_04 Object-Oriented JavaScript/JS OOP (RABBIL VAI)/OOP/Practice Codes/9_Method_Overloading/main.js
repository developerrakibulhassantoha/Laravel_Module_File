/*
ðŸŸª Object-oriented languages like Java or C++, method overloading allows a
class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

ðŸŸª However, in JavaScript, there's no direct support for method overloading
in the traditional sense.

ðŸŸª Yet, you can simulate method overloading by examining the number of
arguments passed and then deciding how to handle them within the function.
